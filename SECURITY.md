## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the `telegram_notif_api` project, please report it by sending an email to `security@example.com`. Please include the following information in your report:

- A descriptive title for the vulnerability
- A detailed description of the issue, including the steps to reproduce it
- The potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

We take security issues seriously and will respond to your report as soon as possible. Once we have reviewed the issue, we will work on a fix and coordinate the release of the patch.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your `telegram_notif_api` deployment, please follow these best practices:

1. **Use Secure Authentication**: Instead of the basic username and password check provided in the sample code, implement a more secure authentication method, such as API keys or OAuth.
2. **Validate and Sanitize User Input**: Carefully validate and sanitize all user input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
3. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to your API to prevent abuse and protect your system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
4. **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date**: Regularly update the dependencies used in your project to ensure you have the latest security patches.
5. **Secure Your Deployment**: Ensure that your server and network infrastructure are properly secured, with up-to-date software, firewalls, and other security measures in place.
6. **Monitor and Respond to Security Alerts**: Subscribe to security mailing lists and vulnerability databases to stay informed about the latest security threats, and be prepared to respond quickly to any issues that may affect your deployment.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure the security and reliability of your `telegram_notif_api` installation.
